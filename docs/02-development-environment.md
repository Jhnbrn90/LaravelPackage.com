# Development Environment

## Installing Composer

There's a big chance that you already have Composer installed. However, in the case you haven't installed Composer already, the quickest way to get up and running is by copying the script provided on the download page of [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/). By copying and pasting the provided script in your command line, the `composer.phar` installer will be downloaded, run and removed again. You can verify a successful installation by running `composer --version`. To update composer to the latest version, run `composer self-update`.

## Package Skeleton

To start with developing a package, first create an empty directory. It is not necessary to nest packages in an existing Laravel project and I would highly recommend to keep your packages separate from your (Laravel) projects to be able to easily differentiate between them.

Personally, my packages are stored in `~/packages/` and my Laravel apps live in `~/websites/`.

## Composer.json

In the root of your package, first create a `composer.json` file with the following minimal configuration (as shown below). Of course, replace all details with your own.

It is important that you are consistent with naming your packages. The common convention is to use your GitHub / Gitlab / Bitbucket / etc.` username followed by a forward slash (“/“) and then a kebab cased version of your package name.

An example `composer.json` is highlighted below.

```json
{
  "name": "johndoe/blogpackage",
  "description": "A demo package",
  "type": "library",
  "license": "MIT",
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@doe.com"
    }
  ],
  "require": {}
}
```

Alternatively, you can create your `composer.json` file by running `composer init` in your empty package directory.

If you’re planning to **publish** the package, it is important to choose an appropriate package type (in our case a “library”) and license (e.g. “MIT”). Learn more about open source licenses at [ChooseALicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/).

## Namespacing

If we want to use the conventional `src/` directory to store our code, we need to tell Composer to map the package’s namespace to that specific directory when creating the autoloader (`vendor/autoload.php`).

We can register our namespace under the “psr-4” autoload key in the `composer.json` file as follows (replace the namespace with your own):

```json
{
  ...,

  "require": {},

  "autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
      "JohnDoe\\BlogPackage\\": "src"
    }
  }
}
```

## PSR-4 Autoloading

Now, you might wonder why we needed a "psr-4" key. PSR stands for PHP Standards Recommendations devised by the [PHP Framework Interoperability Group](https://www.php-fig.org/) (PHP-FIG). This group of 20 members, representing a cross-section of the PHP community, proposed a [series of PSR's](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/).

In the list, PSR-4 represents a recommendation regarding autoloading classes from filepaths, replacing the until then prevailing [PSR-0 autoloading standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-0/).

The major difference between PSR-0 and PSR-4 being that PSR-4 allows to map a base directory to a certain namespace and therefore allowing shorter namespaces. I think [this comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24868586/what-are-the-differences-between-psr-0-and-psr-4/50226226#50226226) on StackOverflow has a clear description of how PSR-0 and PSR-4 work.

PSR-0

```json
"autoload": {
    "psr-0": {
        "Book\\": "src/",
        "Vehicle\\": "src/"
    }
}
```

- Looking for `Book\History\UnitedStates` in `src/Book/History/UnitedStates.php`

- Looking for `Vehicle\Air\Wings\Airplane` in `src/Vehicle/Air/Wings/Airplane.php`

PSR-4

```json
"autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
        "Book\\": "src/",
        "Vehicle\\": "src/"
    }
}
```

- Looking for `Book\History\UnitedStates` in `src/History/UnitedStates.php`

- Looking for `Vehicle\Air\Wings\Airplane` in `src/Air/Wings/Airplane.php`

## Importing the Package Locally

To help with development, you can require a local package in a local Laravel project.

If you have a local Laravel project, you can require your package locally, by defining a custom so called "repository" in the `composer.json` file **of your Laravel application**.

Add the following "repositories" key below the "scripts" section in composer.json file of your Laravel app (replace the "url" with the directory where your package lives):

```json
{
  "scripts": { ... },

  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "path",
      "url": "../../packages/blogpackage"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can now require your local package in the Laravel application using your chosen namespace of the package. Following our example, this would be:

```bash
composer require johndoe/blogpackage
```

**Important:** you will need to perform a composer update in your Laravel application whenever you make changes to the `composer.json` file of your package or any providers it registers.

## Orchestra Testbench

We now have a `composer.json` file and an empty src/ directory. However, we don’t have access to any Laravel specific functionality as provided by the `Illuminate` components.

To use these components in our package, we’ll require the [Orchestra Testbench](https://github.com/orchestral/testbench). Note that each version of the Laravel framework has a corresponding version of Orchestra Testbench. In this post, I’ll assume we’re developing a package for **Laravel 6.0** which is the latest version at the moment of writing this post.

```bash
composer require --dev "orchestra/testbench=^4.0"
```

Now that we've installed the Orchestra Testbench package, we'll find an `orchestra` folder in the `vendor` directory of our package. In that folder, you'll see there is a `laravel` folder containing the `Illuminate` helpers and a `testbench-core` folder and in that folder you'll see there is a folder called `laravel` with a complete directory structure of a Laravel project. This allows us to use the Laravel helpers that involve interaction with the project's directory structure (for example related to file manipulation).

Before each test, a testing environment including a fully booted (test) application is created. If we use the Orchestra TestBench's basic `TestCase` for our tests, the methods as provided by the `CreatesApplication` trait in the `Orchestra\Testbench\Concerns` namespace will be responsible for creating this test application. If we look at one of these methods, `getBasePath()` we'll see it directly points to the `laravel` folder that comes with Orchestra Testbench.

```php
// 'vendor/orchestra/testbench-core/src/Concerns/CreatesApplication.php'
﻿/**
 * Get base path.
 *
 * @return string
 */
protected function getBasePath()
{
    return __DIR__.'/../../laravel';
}
```
