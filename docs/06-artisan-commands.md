# Artisan Commands

Laravel ships with a PHP executable 'artisan' file, providing a command-line interface (CLI) for the framework. Via this CLI, you can access commands as `php artisan migrate` and `php artisan make:model Post`. There are a lot of things you could do with commands. Make sure to read up on the artisan console in the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/artisan).

Let's say that we want to provide an easy artisan command for our end user to publish the config file, via: `php artisan blogpackage:install`.

## Creating a New Command

Create a new `Console` folder in the `src/` directory and create a new file named `InstallBlogPackage.php`. This class will extend Laravel's `Command` class and provide a `$signature` (the command) and a `$description` property. In the `handle()` method we specify what our command will do. In this case, we provide some feedback that we're "installing" the package and we'll call another artisan command to publish the config file. Finally, we let the user know that we're done.

```php
// 'src/Console/InstallBlogPackage.php'
<?php

namespace JohnDoe\BlogPackage\Console;

use Illuminate\Console\Command;

class InstallBlogPackage extends Command
{
    protected $signature = 'blogpackage:install';

    protected $description = 'Install the BlogPackage';

    public function handle()
    {
        $this->info('Installing BlogPackage...');

        $this->info('Publishing configuration...');

        $this->call('vendor:publish', [
            '--provider' => "JohnDoe\BlogPackage\BlogPackageServiceProvider",
            '--tag' => "config"
        ]);

        $this->info('Installed BlogPackage');
    }
}
```

## Registering the Command in the Service Provider

We need to present this package functionality to the end user, thus registering it in the package's service provider.

Since we only want to provide this functionality from the command-line we'll add it within the if-runningInConsole()-statement (don't forget to import the class):

```php
// 'BlogPackageServiceProvider.php'
use JohnDoe\BlogPackage\Console\InstallBlogPackage;
﻿
public function boot()
{﻿
  if ($this->app->runningInConsole()) {
    // publish config file

    $this->commands([
        InstallBlogPackage::class,
    ]);
  }
}
```

## Testing the Artisan Command

To test that our command works, let's create a new unit test called `InstallBlogPackageTest.php` in the Unit test folder.

Since we’re using **Orchestra Testbench**, we have a config folder at `config_path()` containing every file a normal Laravel installation would have. (You can check where this directory lives yourself if you `dd(config_path()))`. Therefore, we can easily assert that this directory should have our `blogpackage.php` config file after running our artisan command. To make sure we're starting at a clean state, let's delete any remainder configuration file from the previous test first.

```php
// 'tests/Unit/InstallBlogPackageTest.php'
<?php

namespace JohnDoe\BlogPackage\Tests\Unit;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Artisan;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\File;
use JohnDoe\BlogPackage\Tests\TestCase;

class InstallBlogPackageTest extends TestCase
{
    /** @test */
    function the_install_command_copies_the_configuration()
    {
        // make sure we're starting from a clean state
        if (File::exists(config_path('blogpackage.php'))) {
            unlink(config_path('blogpackage.php'));
        }

        $this->assertFalse(File::exists(config_path('blogpackage.php')));

        Artisan::call('blogpackage:install');

        $this->assertTrue(File::exists(config_path('blogpackage.php')));
    }
}
```

## Hiding a Command

There might be cases where you'd like to exclude the command from the list of Artisan commands. You can define a `$hidden` property on the command class, which will not show the specific command in the list of Artisan commands. Note, however, that the command can still be used and is only hidden.

```php
class InstallBlogPackage extends Command
{
    protected $hidden = true;

    protected $signature = 'blogpackage:install';

    protected $description = 'Install the BlogPackage';

    public function handle()
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Creating a Generator Command

Laravel provides an easy way to create _Generator_ Commands, _i.e._ commands with signatures such as `php artisan make:controller`. Those commands modify a general, predefined template (stub) to a specific application. For example by automatically injecting the correct the namespace.

In order to create a Generator Command, you have to extend the `Illuminate\Console\GeneratorCommand` class, and override the following properties and methods:

- `protected $name`: name of the command
- `protected $description`: description of the command
- `protected $type`: the type of class the command generates
- `protected function getStub()`: method returning the path of the stub template file
- `protected function getDefaultNamespace($rootNamespace)`: the default namespace of the generated class
- `public function handle()`: the body of the command

The `GeneratorCommand` base class provides some helper methods:

- `getNameInput()`: returns the name passed from command line execution
- `qualifyClass(string $name)`: returns the qualified class name for a given class name
- `getPath(string $name)`: returns the file path for a given name

Consider the following example for the `php artisan make:foo MyFoo` command:

```php
<?php

namespace JohnDoe\BlogPackage\Console;

use Illuminate\Console\GeneratorCommand;

class MakeFooCommand extends GeneratorCommand
{
    protected $name = 'make:foo';

    protected $description = 'Create a new foo class';

    protected $type = 'Foo';

    protected function getStub()
    {
        return __DIR__ . '/stubs/foo.php.stub';
    }

    protected function getDefaultNamespace($rootNamespace)
    {
        return $rootNamespace . '\Foo';
    }

    public function handle()
    {
        parent::handle();

        $this->doOtherOperations();
    }

    protected function doOtherOperations()
    {
        // Get the fully qualified class name (FQN)
        $class = $this->qualifyClass($this->getNameInput());

        // get the destination path, based on the default namespace
        $path = $this->getPath($class);

        $content = file_get_contents($path);

        // Update the file content with additional data (regular expressions)

        file_put_contents($path, $content);
    }
}
```

Note that the class is exported to a directory **based on the namespace** as specified in the `getDefaultNamespace()` method.

### Creating a Stub

You are free to store stubs in a different directory, but for now consider storing stubs in the `Console\stub` directory. For our `Foo` class generator, the stub could look as follows:

```php
// 'stubs/foo.php.stub'
<?php

namespace DummyNamespace;

use JohnDoe\BlogPackage\Foo;

class DummyClass implements Foo
{
    public function myFoo()
    {
        // foo
    }
}
```

Note that `DummyNamespace` and `DummyClass` are placeholders (strictly defined in the `GeneratorCommand` base class: Laravel expects these specific names to replace) and are automatically replaced with the correct values.

## Testing Generator Commands

We can add a feature test for this command in the `tests/Feature` directory, called `MakeFooCommandTest.php` which verifies that a new file is created and contains the correct contents:

```php
<?php

namespace JohnDoe\BlogPackage\Tests\Feature;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\File;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Artisan;
use JohnDoe\BlogPackage\Tests\TestCase;

class MakeFooCommandTest extends TestCase
{
    /** @test */
    function it_creates_a_new_foo_class()
    {
        // destination path of the Foo class
        $fooClass = app_path('Foo/MyFooClass.php');

        // make sure we're starting from a clean state
        if (File::exists($fooClass)) {
            unlink($fooClass);
        }

        $this->assertFalse(File::exists($fooClass));

        // Run the make command
        Artisan::call('make:foo MyFooClass');

        // Assert a new file is created
        $this->assertTrue(File::exists($fooClass));

        // Assert the file contains the right contents
        $expectedContents = <<<CLASS
<?php

namespace App\Foo;

use JohnDoe\BlogPackage\Foo;

class MyFooClass implements Foo
{
    public function myFoo()
    {
        // foo
    }
}
CLASS;

        $this->assertEquals($expectedContents, file_get_contents($fooClass));
    }
}
```

## Create a Test-Only Command

There are some situations in which you would like to only use a certain command for testing and not in your application itself. For example when your package provides a `Trait` that can be used by Command classes. To test the trait, you want to test with an actual command.

The command itself doesn't add functionality to the package and should therefore not be published. However, merely excluding the command from the service provider is not the solution as you want to be able to run the command in your tests.

An elegant solution [suggested by Marcel Pociot](https://twitter.com/marcelpociot/status/1219274939565514754) is to: register the Command **only** in the tests, by hooking into Laravel's `Application::starting()` method:

```php
<?php

namespace JohnDoe\BlogPackage\Tests\Feature;

use JohnDoe\BlogPackage\Tests\Commands\TestCommand;
use Illuminate\Console\Application;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Artisan;
use Orchestra\Testbench\TestCase;

class TestCommandTest extends TestCase
{
   /** @test **/
   public function it_does_a_certain_thing()
   {
        Application::starting(function ($artisan) {
            $artisan->add(app(TestCommand::class));
        });

        // Running the command
        Artisan::call('test-command:run');

       // assertions...
   }
}
```
